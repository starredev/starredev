## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm a fullstack developer at heart and a network engineer by trade.  
I love crafting applications that solve real-world problems — currently focusing on building **CRM** and **HRM** solutions for my clients.

When I'm not managing networks or developing tools, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects or experimenting with new tech stacks.
